## How to use ? 🤖
### Note that I'm talking about main.py, but in the future I'll be uploading more content 

1. Run the application by double-clicking the main.py
2. Paste your community profile (code or name url)
3. The same window will show a popup with the info's
4. Your wishlist will be saved on Output dir

## How does this code works? 👷‍♂️

It's pretty simple, just a web-scrapping passing your wishlist with pandas to make everything goes
to a dataframe (just to sum the column 'Price'). The output is done like a caveman. My focus here
isn't performance, but if you have something to share feel free to do so.

## What can I expect in the future? 🐷

I'm pretending to run a SQL with the games on my wishlist. Updating the price and show the lowest price
ever registered.
