## How to use ? 🤖
### Note that I'm talking about main.py, but in the future I'll be uploading more content 

1. Run the application by double-clicking the main.py
2. Paste your community profile (code or name url)
3. The same window will show a popup with the info's
4. Your wishlist will be saved on Output dir

## How does this code works? 👷‍♂️

It's pretty simple, just a web-scrapping passing your wishlist with pandas to make everything goes
to a dataframe (just to sum the column 'Price'). The output is done like a caveman. My focus here
isn't performance, but if you have something to share feel free to do so.

## What can I expect in the future? 🐷

I'm intending to run a SQL with the games on my wishlist. Updating the price and show the lowest price
ever registered.

Here is how the DB will look like (any suggestions, please feel free to do it so).
